            Hello! Welcome to my API Project for Career Foundry. This api will hold favorite movies as instructed in the course.
            However I will app on a search feature and styling later on down the line as a test of my skills.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Return a list of all movies to the user</li>
            <li>Return data (description, genre, director, image URL, whether it is featured or not) about a single movie by title to the user</li>
            <li>Return data about a genre (description) by name/title (e.g., "Thriller")</li>
            <li>Return data about a director (bio, birth year, death year) by name</li>
            <li>Allow new users to register</li>
            <li>Allow users to update their user info (username)</li>
            <li>Allow users to add a movie to their list of favorites (showing only a text that a movie has been added-more on this later)</li>
            <li>Allow users to remove a movie from their list of favorites (showing only a text that a movie has been removed-more on this later)</li>
            <li>Allow existing users to deregister (showing only a text that a user email has been removed-more on this later)</li>
        </ul>
